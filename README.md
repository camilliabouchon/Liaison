# Liaison
This script reads a cleaned-up orthographic transcription of corpora from CHILDES (extract.txt, obtained through another script) and transcribes it phonologically based on the Lexique380 French dictionary (french.dic). I additionally apply a semi-automatic mandatory liaison (in the future I plan to implement a GUI to check case by case). The output is a phonological transcription (for the moment called outputpruebav2.txt) and a list of all the liaison cases found for checking (liaisonv2.txt).

To Do: Denasalization of vowels before liaison n, check regular exceptions, implement GUI for case-by-case checking, add peut-Ãªtre case.
